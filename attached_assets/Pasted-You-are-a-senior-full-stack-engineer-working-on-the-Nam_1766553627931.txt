You are a senior full-stack engineer working on the NameWizard.io app hosted on Replit.

GOAL (HIGH LEVEL)
Implement a clean, minimal configuration layer for AI and OCR providers in the **in-app API Key Management UI** that:

- Supports multiple model versions per provider (e.g., GPT-5.2, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-3.5 for OpenAI).
- Allows enabling/disabling each model per pricing plan:
  - free
  - credits_low (small credit packs)
  - credits_high (large credit packs)
  - unlimited (Pro Unlimited)
- Defines a clear failover order per plan and category:
  - Primary → Secondary → Tertiary → Optional.
- Keeps the existing UI controls and navigation intact.

-------------------------
1. LOCATION & SCOPE (LOCKED)
-------------------------
- This work is ONLY for the **in-app API Key Management UI**, opened from the **avatar dropdown menu**.
- It already has three tabs:
  1) AI Providers
  2) Cloud Storage
  3) OCR Providers

You MUST:
- NOT touch the landing page or main marketing site.
- NOT change the tab structure, routes, or the avatar dropdown link that opens API Key Management.

-------------------------
2. WHAT MUST STAY AS-IS
-------------------------
For every provider card (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OCR vendors), keep these elements exactly as they are:

- Provider name and icon
- API key field
- Usage/cost gauge and usage bar
- Test button
- Update button
- Support button
- Provider-level Enable/Disable toggle

Do NOT:
- Rename, remove, or move these elements.
- Change their existing behavior, except to optionally hook them into the new config logic internally.

-------------------------
3. WHAT TO ADD / CHANGE – AI PROVIDERS TAB
-------------------------
Inside the **AI Providers** tab:

A) Provider card stays, model list becomes configurable
- Keep each provider card (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, etc.) as a single card.
- Replace the simple "Available Models" chips with a **model configuration table/list INSIDE each provider card**.

B) Model rows
For each model the provider can use (examples for OpenAI):

- GPT-5.2 Pro / Thinking (latest, top-tier)
- GPT-4o Mini / GPT-4 Turbo (standard)
- GPT-3.5 Turbo (legacy)

Show a row with:
- Model name/version (label)
- Category tags: text / vision / audio (as appropriate)

Per model, add controls for each plan:
- Checkboxes:
  - [ ] Enable for Free
  - [ ] Enable for Credits – Low
  - [ ] Enable for Credits – High
  - [ ] Enable for Unlimited
- For every plan where the model is enabled, show a Priority dropdown:
  - Primary
  - Secondary
  - Tertiary
  - Optional

This must support configurations like:

- GPT-5.2:
  - Enabled for: Credits-High, Unlimited
  - Credits-High: Primary text (and/or vision)
  - Unlimited: Primary text/vision

- GPT-4o:
  - Enabled for: Free, Credits-Low
  - Free: Primary text
  - Credits-Low: Primary text

- GPT-3.5:
  - Enabled for: Free
  - Free: Secondary or Tertiary text

C) Optional plan filter bar
- Inside each provider card, you may add a visual filter bar:
  - [Free] [Credits – Low] [Credits – High] [Unlimited]
- This is for focusing the UI only; it must NOT alter stored data by itself.

D) Front-end constraints
- Reuse the existing styles and layout.
- DO NOT introduce new frameworks or redesign the whole page.
- This is an extension of the existing cards, not a replacement.

-------------------------
4. WHAT TO ADD / CHANGE – OCR PROVIDERS TAB
-------------------------
Inside the **OCR Providers** tab:

A) Keep existing OCR provider cards unchanged at the top level:
- API key/project/region fields
- Usage/cost gauge
- Test / Update / Support
- Provider-level Enable/Disable toggle

B) Add per-plan controls at provider level
- For each OCR provider (e.g., Google Document AI / Vision OCR, AWS Textract, Azure Document Intelligence):

  Add controls:
  - Plan enable checkboxes:
    - [ ] Enable for Free
    - [ ] Enable for Credits – Low
    - [ ] Enable for Credits – High
    - [ ] Enable for Unlimited
  - For each plan where it is enabled, a Priority dropdown:
    - Primary / Secondary / Tertiary / Optional
