Content-Based Categorization

Feature: Auto-sort files into folders using AI analysis of content

Use Case: "Organize vacation photos into Beach, Mountains, and City folders automatically"

Implementation: Use CLIP embeddings for image/text similarity matching

Duplicate Detection

Feature: Identify near-duplicates using perceptual hashing (phash) + semantic similarity

Use Case: Flag similar documents/images even with different filenames/resolutions

Implementation: Generate vector embeddings for content comparison

Smart Tagging

Feature: Auto-generate searchable metadata tags (e.g., "Contract", "Q4 Report")

Example: Report.pdf → Tags: ["Financial", "Quarterly", "2024"]

Implementation: Fine-tune a BERT model on document classification

Automatic Translations

Feature: Translate filenames/content while preserving extensions

Use Case: 会议记录.docx → Meeting-Minutes.docx

Implementation: Integrate OpenAI Whisper/Google Translate API

Content Summarization

Feature: Generate summaries for documents/images in filename/tooltip

Example: Sales-Report-Q3.pdf → "Q3 revenue up 15% in EMEA region"

Implementation: Use GPT-4 Turbo vision capabilities for multimodal analysis

Predictive Organization

Feature: Learn user patterns to suggest filing locations/rules

Use Case: "You usually put client PDFs in /Contracts/ - move there?"

Implementation: Track user actions with a lightweight ML model

Accessibility Automation

Feature: Auto-generate alt text for images, closed captions for videos

Example: sunset.jpg → Alt: "Orange sunset over ocean with palm trees"

Implementation: Use BLIP-2 for image captioning

Sensitive Content Detection

Feature: Flag PII/credentials in files using NLP pattern matching

Use Case: "Warning: passwords.csv contains credit card numbers"

Implementation: Train a custom spaCy NER model

Version Intelligence

Feature: Auto-detect file versions using semantic diffing

Example: Proposal_v2_AI-updates.docx → "Updated pricing section"

Implementation: Text embeddings + semantic chunk comparison

Content-Based Search

Feature: "Find files mentioning 'API rate limits' across all formats"

Implementation: Create a vector database (e.g., Pinecone) with file embeddings
